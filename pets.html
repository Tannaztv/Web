      <h1>My Pets</h1>
      <h2>Lily:</h2>
      <p>Lily is a female dog. She's 2 years old now. She's really playful and always wants to run and play.Her favorite fruits are watermelon, grape and strawberry.Unlike other dogs she actually likes to chase laser pointers and when she's chasing the pointer she runs like Usian Bolt ðŸ˜‚. Lily likes eating biscuits and chips and when she's full, she hides the rest of what she's eating but she never succeeded so you can find a lot of biscuits in our house and maybe if you're lucky you'll find some chips. She hates baths and getting her nails clipped and i can say those are the hardest thing to do for both Lily and I.</p>
      <h2>Zico:</h2>
      <p>Zico is a male German Shepherd. He's named after Arthur Antunes Coimbra, Brazilian football coach and former player who used to play as an attacking midfielder. Despite being a German Shepherd, He likes getting pets from people. It doesn't matter who the person is for Zico, he'd let anyone pet him. He likes playing with water bottles a lot. He really likes chicken and you could say it's his favorite food. Zico is actually tall and when he stands he's even taller than me. </p>
      <h2>Fandoq:</h2>
      <p>Fandoq was a female Cockateil, You might be wondering what's up with her name and I should tell you that Fandoq means hazelnut in Persian. She loved grapes and watermelon and whenever I was eating any of them she was there sharing my fruits with me. I said she was a Cockateil because unfortunately we lost her as she was sick. The only word that she learnt was hello, I tried to teach her more words and even how to sings but she never leart anything else. When we got her I didn't know that birds can't see windows and that resulted to Fandoq bumping to the window and then I searched and found out the reason of her bumping to the window and I never opened the curtains after that. She also liked to sit on the curtains. she had a lot of toys cage for when she didn't want to be outside and she used a lot of them. The only toy she didn't like was her swing which I never understood why she never uses it. Whenever I played birds voice for her she would only listen to them, she wouldn't try to communicate with them.</p>
      <h2>Jordan:</h2>
      <p>Jordan is also a male dog. We got him when he was alomost 2 months old. he likes playing with water bottles, what's up with dogs and water bottles. He also likes playing with balls but every dog likes playing with balls. He liked his treats a lot and she always wanted more. He was a hairy dog and you would think he's really fat but you could see how small he actually is whenever he had his hair cut.</p>
