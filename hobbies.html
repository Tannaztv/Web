       <h1>My hobbies</h1>
       <h2>Watching soccer matches</h2>
       <p>I like watching soccer matches, usually the players play very well and that makes the game 10 times better. My favorite soccer teams are barcelona, paris saint german and perspolis from Iran. My favorite players are Messi, Neymar, Suarez and I also like players who care about their playing style more than winning. Nowadays, don't care about the match, they only want to win no matter how bad they play. I like laliga and champions league games a lot, laliga is the soccer league from Spain and champions league is a league for champions.</p>
       <h2>Listening to music</h2>
       <p>I also like listening to good music. Whenever I'm in a bad mood the only thing that can cheer me up is a good song, I like pop songs the most but that is not the only music genre that I like. There are a lot of singers that I like but the ones that I like the most are Taylor Swift, Lauren Jauregui, Hayley Kiyoko and Harry Styles, they sing really well and I also like how they perfomance.</p>
       <h2>Reading books</h2>
       <P>Reading books is one of my hobbies, I used to read a book everyday but now I don't read many books. When I was a child I would finish a soon as I got home after I bought. I loved reading books more than anything growing up but now I only read books when I needed to look for something in the book. My favorite books are seven important things and A man called Ove. I owe wanting to read books to my parents, mostly my dad. He said he would give me books knowing I'm not able to read and I would tear them up. People would tell him that what's he's doing is useless but he didn't stop and that actually worked. I would start reading a new book and I would always finish it in the same day, no matter how many pages there was in the book. </P>
       <h2>Coding</h2>
       <p>As you might have guessed I also like coding a lot. I code a lot in my free time. Sometimes I watch tutorial on new things and I will watch them and write and code the things that I learnt. One of my biggest hobbies is coding I like it a lot and I think I already talked too much about it.</p>
       <h2>Watching a movie</h2>
       <p>Like every other teenager I like watching movies and series a lot. There are a lot of amazing movies there and even if someone decides to watch 100 movies daily which is obviously impossible, there will be a lot of movies that they haven't watched. I don't have a favorite genre in movies as well, I just want to watch a good movie. It doesn't have to be a specific genre of movie because there's not a genre that only has perfect movies and not even one bad movie. There are a lot of hardworking directors that make impressive movies, One of them is Christopher Nolan. He makes fantastic movies like Interstellar, Tenet , Inception and there are a lof of his movies that I haven't talked about. Nolan is one of the best directors in the world and we should be happy that we live in the same generation as him.</p>
